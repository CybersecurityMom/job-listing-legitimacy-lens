# Job Listing Legitimacy Lens

This is a tiny prototype that gives a rough “trust score” for job listings using simple rule-based checks. It was inspired by a mental model developed earlier in the Innovation Lab exploring how job seekers determine whether a job posting is legitimate.

This is NOT a real security tool.  
It is a simple teaching prototype that turns mental models into code.
